# Interactive COVID Chart

A simple example of loading local CSV data and plotting it on a chart using Chart.js

## To Do

- Select from full country list
- Swap between cases and deaths data
- Animate line on load / change
- Allow user to change time period
- Don't allow negative numbers?
- Deal with single, extremely high entries (they change the scale of the whole chart)
